for this first we are going to need to have a surface with the text the user is supposed to be typing out


Next we are going to need to take User Input.


The Next step after that is we are going to need to be able to find a way to manipulate that input.


After that we are going to need to find a way to check the text of the paragraph against the User Input.


Then we are going to need to find a way to change the look of the paragraph based on that user input.


Then were pretty much done, to finish it off we can add states like starting state and ending states to our project.
